// https://www.candlescanner.com/candlestick-patterns/two-crows/
// The Two Crows is a three-line bearish reversal candlestick pattern.
// The pattern requires confirmation, that is, the following candles should break
// a trendline or the nearest support area which may be formed by the first candleâ€™s line.
// If the pattern is not confirmed it may act only as a temporary pause within an uptrend.
// Although the pattern name suggest that two lines form it, in fact, it contains three lines
